# Naive-Bayes-implementation-without-GaussianNB
Implemented a generic NaiveBayes model without using GaussianNB

The datassets used for the above model can be found in the master. The sreenshots are attached as well(SS).
The accuracy of the model depends on the dataset. It ranges from 60-99% for my model. 
The preprocessing code is attached as well.

Basically the code is divided into four main fucntions(&subfuncs),
- preprocesing of data. Implemented in function - preprocess_datasetName
- train 
- predict
- evaluate 

Results are summarized and can be found in results_accuracy.xlxs
